# iDora

This is a small exploratory tool which could help you to get to know your dataset better. 

Import the file with the name iDora_main in order to start. 

Project desription:

"eda" - contains functions and required packages to do Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset. For example, this file contains function to create descriptive statistics summary table with barplots and boxplots. 

"fi" - Feature Inspection, contains functions and objects to do feature importance analysis. For example, function to obtian Mutual Information scores for each feature.


"idora_main" - contains predefined pipeline for analysis of a dataset. Comment out the functions which you do not need and customize your EDA workflow there. Ifyou just would like to use functions from idora_eda and idora_featimp, import idora_main without "main_run" function.

"settings" - a helper file which stores global variables which are used by the main code.

In order to get a feel of iDora, follow a ipynotebook example on master branch.

Thanks for cheking this out.
